        The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a
        community of people interested in evolving HTML and related
        technologies. It is a community that maintains and develops web
        standards.

        <q class="q-2" style="font-weight: bold"
          >Employees of Apple, Mozilla, and Opera established WHATWG in 2004.</q

      </p>

      <p>
        W3C and the WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development
        of a single version of the HTML and DOM (Document Object Model)
        specifications on May 28 2019.

    <div>
      <details>
        <summary>Click here for details!</summary>
        I'm nested in a details element, and I'm usually a small detail tucked
        away here!
      </details>

      <p class="p-details" style="font-weight: bold">
        The details and summary elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details element generates a revealing widget, which only displays
        information when the widget is toggled to the "open" position. The
        summary element must contain a summary or label.
      </p>

      <aside>
        <h4 class="aside-h4">This is an example of aside element.</h4>
        <p>
          The aside element represents a section of a page that contains content
          that is slightly related to but different from the content surrounding
          the aside element. For example, a key phrase, quotation, advertising,
          or sidebars.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        The widget is usually represented by a small triangle that rotates to
        indicate open or closed positions, along with a phrase next to the
        triangle. The contents of the summary element are used as the label for
        the revealing widget.

        Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,
        "Good gracious! how you hop!
        Over the fields and the water too,
        As if you never would stop!
        My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
        And I long to go out in the world beyond!
        I wish I could hop like you!"
        Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
