      <h2>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</h2>

      <p>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards
        organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and led by Tim
        Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that
        maintain full-time staff working together in the development of
        standards for the World Wide Web.
      </p>

      <p class="w3c-2">
        The World Wide Web Consortium began the year 2023 by forming a new
        public-interest non-profit organization. The new entity preserves our
        member-driven approach, existing worldwide outreach and cooperation
        while allowing for additional partners around the world beyond Europe
        and Asia. The new organization also preserves the core process and
        mission of the Consortium to shepherd the web, by developing open web
        standards as a single global organization with contributions from W3C
        Members, staff, and the international community.
      </p>

      <p class="w3c-3">Our Director, Tim Berners-Lee, noted:</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Today, I am proud of the profound impact W3C has had, its many
        achievements accomplished with our Members and the public, and I look
        forward to the continued empowering enhancements W3C enables as it
        launches its own public-interest non-profit organization, building on 28
        years of experience.”
      </blockquote>

      <p class="w3c-3">
        Our vision for the future is a web that is truly a force for good. A
        World Wide Web that is truly international and more inclusive, more
        respectful of its users. A web that supports truth better than
        falsehood, people more than profits, humanity rather than hate. A web
        that works for everyone, because of everyone. For more information visit
